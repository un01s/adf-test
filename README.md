# esp-adf diff repo

This is just a simple clone of esp-adf. The purpose is to find out the difference between the original repo with some generic board modification.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-adf
```

Some hidden files are removed because they are irrelevant.

Then copy adf-changes from [ESP32-IQ](https://github.com/thaaraak/ESP32-IQ) into ```esp-adf/components/aduio_board```.
